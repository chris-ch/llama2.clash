===============================================================================
THE 5 STEPS (Quick Summary)
===============================================================================

âœ… Step 1 (1-2 hrs): Add row addressing
   File: WeightLoaderAddressing.hs
   Action: Copy weightAddressGenerator into your WeightLoader
   Test: Print addresses, verify counting

âœ… Step 2 (2-3 hrs): Add weight buffering  
   File: WeightBuffer.hs
   Action: Create new module, instantiate buffer
   Test: Verify buffer fills after 128 cycles

âœ… Step 3 (3-4 hrs): Modify QKV projector
   File: QKVProjectionWithRAM.hs
   Action: Update QKVProjection with weight selection
   Test: Compare useRAM=True vs False

âœ… Step 4 (1-2 hrs): Thread signals through layers
   File: INTEGRATION_GUIDE.txt
   Action: Update signatures in LayerStack, TransformerLayer, etc.
   Test: Code compiles without errors

âœ… Step 5 (2-3 hrs): End-to-end integration
   File: ACTION_PLAN.txt (testing section)
   Action: Run full simulation with weight loading
   Test: Token outputs match expected values

Total time: ~10-15 hours

===============================================================================
HOW TO USE THESE FILES
===============================================================================

For Step 1:
-----------
1. Open WeightLoaderAddressing.hs
2. Read the weightAddressGenerator function
3. Copy it into your LLaMa2/Memory/WeightLoader.hs
4. Add this line in weightManagementSystem:
   (weightAddr, qkvLoadDone) = weightAddressGenerator streamValid loadTrigger
5. Return these signals from weightManagementSystem
6. Compile and test

For Step 2:
-----------
1. Copy WeightBuffer.hs to your project:
   LLaMa2/Layer/Attention/WeightBuffer.hs
2. In Decoder.hs, import and instantiate:
   weightBuffer = qkvWeightBufferController ...
3. Add introspection to observe buffer state
4. Run simulation and verify accumulation

For Step 3:
-----------
1. Open QKVProjectionWithRAM.hs
2. Compare with your current QKVProjection.hs
3. Update your file with the new functions:
   - queryHeadProjectorWithRAM
   - keyValueHeadProjectorWithRAM
   - qkvProjectorWithRAM
4. Test compilation

For Step 4:
-----------
1. Open INTEGRATION_GUIDE.txt
2. Go through each module level
3. Update signatures to accept weightBuffer and useRAM
4. Update call sites to pass these parameters
5. Follow the guide level by level

For Step 5:
-----------
1. Follow testing strategy in ACTION_PLAN.txt
2. Use QUICK_REFERENCE.txt debug checklist
3. Verify each test phase passes

===============================================================================
UNDERSTANDING THE ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

Current State (What You Have):
  âœ“ parsedWeights streaming from RAM
  âœ“ streamValid flag
  âœ“ Top-level infrastructure

Missing (What You Need):
  âœ— Row addressing (where does this row go?)
  âœ— Weight buffering (accumulate into matrices)
  âœ— Weight selection (use RAM instead of hardcoded)

The Solution:
  RAM â†’ Parse â†’ Address â†’ Buffer â†’ Select â†’ Use
        (you)   (Step 1)  (Step 2) (Step 3) (compute)

===============================================================================
GETTING HELP
===============================================================================

If stuck on a specific step:
  "I'm on Step X and [describe issue]"

If code doesn't compile:
  "I get this error: [paste error]"
  "This is my code: [paste relevant section]"

If behavior is wrong:
  "useRAM=False works but useRAM=True gives wrong output"
  "Buffer doesn't accumulate rows"

If confused about architecture:
  "I don't understand how X connects to Y"
  "Where does signal Z come from?"

===============================================================================
KEY FILES TO KEEP OPEN WHILE CODING
===============================================================================

Terminal 1: Your code editor
Terminal 2: QUICK_REFERENCE.txt (for types/signatures)
Terminal 3: ACTION_PLAN.txt (for current step)
Terminal 4: Simulation/testing

===============================================================================
VALIDATION CHECKLIST
===============================================================================

After each step, verify:

Step 1:
  â–¡ weightAddr.rowIndex counts 0â†’7â†’0â†’7...
  â–¡ weightAddr.matrixType cycles Qâ†’Kâ†’V
  â–¡ weightAddr.headIndex increments correctly
  â–¡ qkvLoadDone goes True after 128 rows

Step 2:
  â–¡ Buffer accumulates rows correctly
  â–¡ Each head's matrices fill completely
  â–¡ fullyLoaded flag goes True
  â–¡ Can extract weights with extractQWeight etc.

Step 3:
  â–¡ Code compiles without type errors
  â–¡ useRAM=False works (unchanged behavior)
  â–¡ useRAM=True activates RAM weights
  â–¡ Matrix multiplier accepts selected weights

Step 4:
  â–¡ All modules compile
  â–¡ Signals thread through layers
  â–¡ No type mismatches

Step 5:
  â–¡ Weights load from RAM correctly
  â–¡ Computation uses RAM weights
  â–¡ Output tokens match expected values

ESTIMATED TIMELINE
===============================================================================

Session 1 (3-4 hours):
  - Read documentation (30 min)
  - Implement Step 1 (1-2 hrs)
  - Implement Step 2 (2-3 hrs)
  - Test accumulation

Session 2 (4-5 hours):
  - Implement Step 3 (3-4 hrs)
  - Basic testing (1 hr)

Session 3 (3-4 hours):
  - Implement Step 4 (1-2 hrs)
  - Implement Step 5 (2-3 hrs)
  - Full integration testing

Total: ~10-15 hours over 2-3 sessions

===============================================================================
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
===============================================================================

âœ“ Follow steps in order - don't skip ahead
âœ“ Test after each step before continuing
âœ“ Use QUICK_REFERENCE.txt while coding
âœ“ Read error messages carefully
âœ“ Check types match exactly
âœ“ Add introspection signals liberally
âœ“ Test with useRAM=False first
âœ“ Commit/backup before major changes

===============================================================================
COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID
===============================================================================

âœ— Skipping steps and going straight to Step 5
âœ— Not testing intermediate results
âœ— Type mismatches (check dimensions carefully)
âœ— Forgetting to pass signals through layers
âœ— Not resetting buffer on layer change
âœ— Using weights before fullyLoaded=True
âœ— Mixing up head indices for Q vs KV heads

===============================================================================
NEXT STEPS
===============================================================================

Right now:
1. Read SUMMARY.txt (you might have already)
2. Read ACTION_PLAN.txt
3. Look at DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.txt
4. Start Step 1!

Good luck! You've got a complete roadmap now. ðŸŽ¯
